Git

As there is 2FA enabled to we need to generate new Access token which will be used
as password to connect local git repo to github

Init GIT with app:

git remote add origin https://github.com/ankushkale1/MyNotes.git

git pull --rebase https://github.com/ankushkale1/MyNotes.git  master

git push origin
